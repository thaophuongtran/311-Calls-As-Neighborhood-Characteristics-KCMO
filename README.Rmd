### Intro

From Evicted - Mathew Desmond, we learned that in Milwaukee at the time multiple nuisance activities 911 calls on a property can lead to police service charges to property owners. This might lead to landlord eviction renters. Nuisance activities are especially concentrated in low income, deep poverty neighborhoods. These calls are reported under “Trouble with Subjects”, noise complaints, and domestic violence.

Connecting this to the above literature of using 311 calls as indicators of neighborhood distress and characteristics of urban neighborhoods. In another way, 311 calls can be used as a real time indicator of neighborhood characteristics in addition to much lagged socio-demographic estimates.

### Data

#### About 311 data

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.height=8,fig.width=8, dpi=300}
#add 311 volume to geo data
vol311 = dat %>% group_by(nbhid = NBH_ID) %>% summarise(vol311=n())

#map 311 vol by nbh
shp_sf %>% 
  left_join(vol311, by = "nbhid") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = vol311 ), color = "black")+
  labs(fill = "Total 311 Calls Volume")+
  theme_void()
```

 
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.height=8,fig.width=8, dpi=300}

#summarize 311 volume on NBH level
dat %>%group_by(CATEGORY, NEIGH) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(CATEGORY) %>% 
  summarise(
    Neighborhood_Count = n(),
    Min = min(n),
    Mean = mean(n),
    Median = median(n),
    SD = sd(n),
    Max = max(n),
    Total = sum(n)
  ) %>% kable(digits = 0,format.args = list(big.mark = ","))

```


#### About demographic and socioeconomic data
 
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.height=8,fig.width=8, dpi=300}

# summarise demographic and socioeconomic data
data.frame(t(sec %>% select(-c(NBH_ID,NBH_NAME, Income.Level)))) %>% 
  add_rownames("Socioeconomic_Demographic") %>% 
  melt() %>% 
  group_by(Socioeconomic_Demographic) %>% 
  summarise(
    Neighborhood_Count = n(),
    Min = min(value),
    Mean = mean(value),
    Median = median(value),
    SD = sd(value),
    Max = max(value),
  ) %>% 
  kable(digits = 0,format.args = list(big.mark = ","))
